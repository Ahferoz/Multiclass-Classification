# Multiclass-Classification
Apply Multiclass Classification On Real World Problem

We have used Music Genre Data for Multiclass classification .Here you can learn how to apply multiclass classification. How to  improve performance of model using different techniques.Data was highly skewed so performance was very low.

## Things you can learn from here.

- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

- Target distribution in training and validation set. 

- Different Kinds of plots between targets and features using matplotlib and seaborn .

- Imputing missing values.

- Data preprocessing pipline.

- Model Training on training data and evalution of model on validation data using Logistic Classifiers, Decision Tree ,Random Forest.

- Selecting the best model among three.

- Doing experiments with selected model to enhance performance of model.

- Finalize the model with the best performance.
